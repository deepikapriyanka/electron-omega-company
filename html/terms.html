      <div>EO encourages and permits links to Content on the Site. However, EO is an organization committed to the highest professional standards. Therefore,
        EO does not grant any license or other permission for links or other use of the Site or its Content if such use or link: (a) suggests that EO promotes

        the Content without EO’s express written consent, or (c) uses the Content for commercial purposes. Furthermore, EO does not grant its consent for links

        for any link at any time.

      <div>Subject to your full compliance with these terms, EO authorizes you to view the Content, make a single copy of it, and print that copy, but only
        for your own lawful, personal, noncommercial use, provided that you maintain all copyright, trademark and other intellectual property notices contained

      </div><br>
      <div>RESPONSES TO ONLINE REQUESTS</div><br>
      <div>From time to time, EO may offer to provide information or materials via e-mail or otherwise to interested persons. EO reserves the right, in its
        absolute discretion, to reject any requests for such information or materials, or to discontinue the provision of such information or materials to any
        person, for any reason whatsoever.</div><br>
      <div>PROHIBITED CONDUCT</div><br>
      <div>You may use the Site for lawful purposes only. You may not upload to, or distribute or otherwise publish through the Site, any Content that is any
        of the following:</div><br>
        <ul>

          <li>otherwise violates any applicable criminal or civil law. You may not use the Site for any commercial purpose.</li>
        </ul>
      <div>CONTENT MANAGEMENT AND REMOVAL</div><br>
      <div>EO does not and cannot review generally the content posted by users of the Site ("Users' Content") and is not responsible for such Users' Content. However, EO reserves the right to cancel your access to these areas and/or delete, move, or edit any Users' Content (including messages posted in any forum) that it may determine, in its sole discretion, violates the Terms of Use. You shall remain solely responsible for all Users' Content posted by you or by any other person using your account. EO shall have the right, but not the obligation, to correct any errors or omissions in any Users' Content, as it may determine in its sole discretion.</div><br>

      <div>EO prohibits the posting of any information that infringes or violates the copyright rights and/or other intellectual property rights (including rights of privacy and publicity) of any person or entity. If you believe that your intellectual property right (or such a right that you are responsible for enforcing) is infringed by any content on the Site, please email EO at info@electronomega.com, giving a written statement that contains the following information: (a) an identification of the copyrighted work and/or intellectual property right claimed to have been infringed; (b) an identification of the allegedly infringing material on the Site that is requested to be removed; (c) your name, address, and daytime telephone number, and an e-mail address if available; (d) a statement that you have a good faith belief that the use of the copyrighted work and/or exercise of the intellectual property right is not authorized by the owner, its agent, or the law; (e) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and, under penalty of perjury, that the signatory is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the right that is allegedly infringed; and (f) the signature of the intellectual property right owner or someone authorized on the owner's behalf to assert infringement of the right. EO will remove any posted submission that infringes the copyright or other intellectual property right of any person under U.S. law upon receipt of such a statement (or any statement in conformance with 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(3)). U.S. law provides significant penalties for submitting such a statement falsely. Under appropriate circumstances, persons who repeatedly submit infringing or unlawful material will be prohibited from posting further submissions.</div><br>
      <div>NON-ENDORSEMENT</div><br>
      <div>EO does not represent or endorse the accuracy or reliability of any Users' Content displayed, uploaded, posted on any message board, or otherwise distributed through the Site by any subscriber, information provider or any other third party. EO expressly disclaims any liability related to Users' Content, and you acknowledge that any reliance upon such Subscriber Content shall be at your sole risk.</div><br>

      <div>The Site may contain links to sites on the Internet that are owned and operated by third parties (the "External Sites"). You acknowledge that EO is not responsible for the availability of, or the content or software applications located on or through any External Site. You should contact the site administrator or Webmaster for those External Sites if you have any concerns regarding such links or External Sites.</div><br>
